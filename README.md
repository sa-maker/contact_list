# Introduction

Build a list of contacts in React.

# Behavior

- The contacts should be grouped in tabs.
- When clicking on a contact, its card should be displayed.
- When clicking on the close button of a card, it should disappear.
- While a contact card is being displayed, if another contact is clicked, the first clicked contact card should disappear.

# Next steps

- Setup the code to accept bootstap or Tailwind to alow better maintanance accross multiple developers and improve the responsiveness
- Implement Redux(or similar) for better state management accross components ie. the 'selected' and 'openCard' variables in ContactList.js
- Make the naming international. The tabs are only aplicable to the western names, it needs to extend to international names. this could be fixed with the contactListConfig.json 'tabs' variable. As it is the current system ignores all names that does not fit into the 'tabs' list

## Responsiveness

- the site is responsive. If the flow of the top menu structure is not adequit a better solution can be devised using a diffrent menu system, something like a dropdown or a carosell, but this will be done after a discussion with the UXUI designer

## Build process

1. Reasearch the best code structure for the project
2. Initiate a base codebase
3. Detirmane what technologies required are new, or unclear
4. Build a proof of concept showcasing the new technologies
5. Fleshout the proof of concept into a functional system
6. Ensure that the layout adhears to the design
7. Test the system end to end
8. Update the unittests and the documentation
